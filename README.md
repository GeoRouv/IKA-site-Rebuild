# IKA site rebuild and upgrade

The goal was to redesign the site of the Greek Social Insurance Institute(IKA) in a way that it appeals better to users and make it easy to navigate through it. This implementation divides the users in four distinct categories (insured,retired,employees and disability). Insured and retired categories are developed thoroughly.

For the calculation of pension and insurance, no realistic methods have been used.

Three accounts have been already imported in the database and can be used:

Username : g_rouv\
Password : 1234

Username : tea\
Password : qwerty

Username : Will_S_Jason\
Password : mystikoskwdikos

The folder under the name "sdi1400173" which contains the source code must be copied exatcly on the folder "htdocs" of your computer so it can run on your localhost.
